# Project overview 
 
This project uses [RatInABox](https://github.com/RatInABox-Lab/RatInABox) to implement the article: [A computational model for spatial cognition combining dorsal and ventral hippocampal place field maps: multiscale navigation](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00422-019-00812-x), which uses reinforcement learning to train a model to arrive at a specific point in space from different starting positions;

The intent was to add to the reach of implementations available by the package, while testing its limitations and suggesting improvements. The code is kept in a .ipynb file, and the supporting files are a possible separation for the implementation.
